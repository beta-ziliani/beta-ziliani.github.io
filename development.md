# Software development

{% assign today = site.time | date: '%Y' %}
I've been involved in software development for {{ today | minus: 1998 }} years.  I was always passionate about programming languages, and that's how I ended up doing [research](research.html) in that area.

My [GitHub](https://github.com/beta-ziliani/) profile doesn't lie: my main proficiency today is in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org), [OCaml](https://ocaml.org), and the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) proof assistant. Yet I also touched several other languages in my past lives and in my [courses](./teaching.html), like Haskell, Scala, Rust, Java, C, C#.

In the past {{ today | minus: 2021 }} years I've been leading the development of the Crystal programming language. Managing an industrial language with a mid-size community proved to be a challenge, but I learned that having a great [team](https://www.crystal-lang.org/team) is key to success.

I love coding, but quite frankly, at this point I'm better at letting someone else do it and manage the outcome.

My GitHub chart, simply because graphs are pretty:
